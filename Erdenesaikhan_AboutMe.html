            <p>For most of my life, I have been keen on finishing what I start. When applying for a job, this also applies. For my future goals, I want to have a successful and easy-going life. To accomplish this, I know that I have to work hard: Going through college, studying, etc.
            </p>

            Although school has been a challenge, I have always found myself continuing to try my hardest, and doing whatever I can to accomplish my goals and my assignments. I believe that a major part of school is not only learning the material, but also time management. For years like many others,  I have struggled with this problem of procrastination, but I am confident in myself that I have learned how to be the most efficient of myself. With my experiences, I have also learned how to deal with my problems and assignments, and with them, it flows perfectly to shaping who I am as a person. Who I am personally is very high on my values, so I try to be somebody that I can look up to myself, and improve everyday.

            One of my accomplishments that I value is being organized. My personality as an employee,  mostly revolves around being efficient. Some attributes that I have contributed to this lifestyle, are being systematic, resourceful, and likely the most useful, pure hard work. Being an employee, I would value my job greatly and I would try my best. In conclusion, I have learned from many of my experiences and sculpted skills from my mistakes, and most importantly, to give it my best.

            During this time of difficulty due to the current COVID-19 outbreak, I have been self-isolating to reduce the chance of contracting this disease. Due to my increase in free time in a day, I have invested time into exploring and discovering more basics while learning more information about the world of law. Law is an interest of mine and a career I hope to pursue in the future, and I am excited to take time to see the intricate details. Stay safe!
